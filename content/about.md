title: "About Me"
---

My name is Lau. I am an Operations Engineer based in London, UK.

I am currently working at [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/), and have
previously worked at the [Government Digital
Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk), and started my career at
[Pulsant](https://www.pulsant.com/) (previously
[DediPower](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/04/lumison_acquires_dedipower/))
doing support.

I am interested in helping Software Engineers ship code as painlessly and
efficiently as possible, and working on ways I can make my own job
redundant.

My ambition is to eventually relocate to California, and live by the sea.

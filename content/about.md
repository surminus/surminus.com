title: "About Me"
---

My name is Laura. I am an Operations Engineer based in London, UK.

I am currently working at [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/), and have
previously worked at the [Government Digital
Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk), and [Pulsant](https://www.pulsant.com/) doing
support.

I am interested in helping Software Engineers ship code as painfully and
efficiently as possible, and working on ways I can make my own job
redundant.

My ambition is to eventually relocate to California, and live by the sea.

I was at a friend's place. I'm not sure who this person was, I had never met
them before. She wrote fictional letters to historical people they admired,
telling them why they admired them so much. She grew plants in large jars, and
some of them you were able to drink. She drank strawberry daiquiri cocktails,
with spice.

I remember feeling very at home here, and when I woke up, I wanted to go back
to sleep again to be back there.

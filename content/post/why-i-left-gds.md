It's been a few weeks since I left GDS after almost 3 years working on GOV.UK.

I'm no stranger to saying what I feel. With the Civil Service code, we knew the rules
and so did they. My full commitment was what I was thinking of, but we knew they wouldn't
get away from any else.

I decided long and hard about writing this, but I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make
you understand.

We knew each other for so long. Your heart was aching but you're too shy to say it. Inside
we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're going to play it.

After this, if you ask me how I'm feeling - don't tell me you're blind to see.

Never gonna give you up

Never gonna let you down

Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry

Never gonna say goodbye

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
